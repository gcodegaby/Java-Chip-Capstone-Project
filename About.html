                <div>
                    45 years ago, women’s advocates in Austin established the Austin Rape Crisis Center and the Center for Battered Women, later merging to form SafePlace in 1998. SafePlace became nationally recognized for its innovative programs. Concurrently, concerned citizens founded the Austin-Travis 
                    County Shelter for Infants and Children in 1984, which evolved into the Austin Children’s Shelter. <br><br> In 2015, SafePlace and Austin Children’s Shelter merged to form SAFE, dedicated to ending violence and abuse. Accredited by the Council on Accreditation in 2021, SAFE operates prevention 
                    and crisis programs with an annual budget exceeding $20 million and over 350 employees and volunteers, drawing a line against violence and abuse in Austin.
