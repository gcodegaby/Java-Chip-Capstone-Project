            <div>
                45 years ago, women’s advocates in Austin established the Austin Rape Crisis Center and the Center for
                Battered Women, later merging to form SafePlace in 1998. SafePlace became nationally recognized for its
                innovative programs. Concurrently, concerned citizens founded the Austin-Travis
                County Shelter for Infants and Children in 1984, which evolved into the Austin Children’s Shelter.
                <br><br> In 2015, SafePlace and Austin Children’s Shelter merged to form SAFE, dedicated to ending
                violence and abuse. Accredited by the Council on Accreditation in 2021, SAFE operates prevention
                and crisis programs with an annual budget exceeding $20 million and over 350 employees and volunteers,
                drawing a line against violence and abuse in Austin.

            <div>
                In the upcoming year, SAFE is embarking on several impactful projects to address critical issues in our
                community. Recognizing the link between affordable housing and violence prevention, we are committed to
                expanding access to safe and affordable housing options for vulnerable individuals
                and families. Additionally, we are prioritizing initiatives aimed at ensuring safe home placement for
                children affected by abuse and neglect, providing them with the stability and support they need to
                thrive. To further strengthen our organization's ability to serve survivors effectively,
                we are focusing on staff recruitment and retention, including implementing salary increases to attract
                and retain dedicated professionals. Central to our mission is our ongoing efforts to end the cycle of
                abuse through comprehensive programming and support services, working tirelessly to
                create a safer and more compassionate community for all.
